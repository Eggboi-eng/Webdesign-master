        <p><em>To note is that a hydronium (a water molecule with an additional proton) is regenerated. This isn't considered a catalyst however as a water molecule is consumed to create the alcohol.</em>

        <p><em>The "X" represents a halogen such as Br, Cl, or I. "hv" refers to light, which is typically interpreted as UV radiation. The lone electron selects for the more substituted carbon due to higher stability, thus forcing the "X" group to attach to the less substituted carbon.</em>

        <img src="images/hydrohalogenation.jpg" alt="Reaction involving the addition of a halogen and an -OH group via substitution to an alkene via a halohydrin reaction." length="500" height="500">
        <p><em>A halogen and -OH group end up adding opposite one another from the double bond substitution. The oxygen attaches to the most substituted carbon because if we think of the intermediate faze between the bridge breaking and the water attacking the molecule, the most electropositive region is at the more substituted carbon because the most substituted carbon is the most stable form of carbon cation, thus the less substituted carbon will have more of the electrons in the bond for a longer period of time. There is no rearrangement due to the creation of a halogen bridge.</em></p>
