      <h3>Question 1</h3>
        <p>
            The main trick in the problem is to recongize the number of 
            hydrogens on each carbon. Given that carbon in nearly all 
            practical cases of organic chemistry only contains 4 bonds to abide 
            by the Octet rule and its general bonding characteristics, you can assume the bonds associated to a unique 
            atom (atoms other than hydrogen) by how many hydrogens are attached to a specific carbon. 
            For example the (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub><strong>CH</strong>CO<sub>2</sub>- part 
            of the compound, we can see that because the carbon only has 1 hydrogen
            attatched to it that it must have <strong>3</strong> unique bonds.
            In this case, it is attached to two <strong>methyl groups</strong>
            on the left (methyl indicating a carbon with three hydrogens attatched)
            and a singular carbon on its right for a total of 3 unique bonds.
