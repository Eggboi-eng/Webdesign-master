    <h1>Organic Chemistry 1</h1> 
    <h2><strong>HW 01</strong></h2>
      <h3>Question 1</h3>
        <p>
            The main trick in the problem is to recongize the number of 
            hydrogens on each carbon. Given that carbon in nearly all 
            practical cases of organic chemistry only contains 4 bonds to abide 
            by the Octet rule and its general bonding characteristics, you can assume the bonds associated to a unique 
            atom (atoms other than hydrogen) by how many hydrogens are attached to a specific carbon. 
            For example the (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub><strong>CH</strong>CO<sub>2</sub>- part 
            of the compound, we can see that because the carbon only has 1 hydrogen
            attatched to it that it must have <strong>3</strong> unique bonds.
            In this case, it is attached to two <strong>methyl groups</strong>
            on the left (methyl indicating a carbon with three hydrogens attatched)
            and a singular carbon on its right for a total of 3 unique bonds. This concept
            stays true for other molecules as well, with oxygen typically having <strong>2</strong>
            bonds, nitrogen will tend to have <strong>3</strong>.
            <br>
            Correct Answer: C
            </br>
        </p>
      <h3>Question 2</h3>
        <p>
          Similar in concepts to the first problem, we can determine 
          the correct solution based on the central atom and relate it to the 
          number of bonds that the atom of the specific element typically
          has. A and B are incorrect because they have oxygen and sodium as central
          atoms, which isn't realistic as oxygen is understandably capable of having <strong>2</strong>
          bonds, and sodium has <strong>1</strong>. D is incorrect because it has
          a positive charge on the lowest oxygen atom, and from counting the electrons
          associated with the oxygens valence shell, there are 8, which is 2 more than oxygens ground-state
          of 6.
          <br>
          Correct Answer: C
