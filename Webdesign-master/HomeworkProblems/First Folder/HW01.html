    <h1>Organic Chemistry 1</h1> 
    <h2><strong>HW 01</strong></h2>
      <h3>Question 1</h3>
        <p>
            The main trick in the problem is to recongize the number of 
            hydrogens on each carbon. Given that carbon in nearly all 
            practical cases of organic chemistry only contains 4 bonds to abide 
            by the Octet rule and its general bonding characteristics, you can assume the bonds associated to a unique 
            atom (atoms other than hydrogen) by how many hydrogens are attached to a specific carbon. 
            For example the (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub><strong>CH</strong>CO<sub>2</sub>- part 
            of the compound, we can see that because the carbon only has 1 hydrogen
            attatched to it that it must have <strong>3</strong> unique bonds.
            In this case, it is attached to two <strong>methyl groups</strong>
            on the left (methyl indicating a carbon with three hydrogens attatched)
            and a singular carbon on its right for a total of 3 unique bonds. This concept
            stays true for other molecules as well, with oxygen typically having <strong>2</strong>
            bonds, nitrogen will tend to have <strong>3</strong>.
            <br>
            Correct Answer: C

        </p>
      <h3>Question 2</h3>
        <p>
          Similar in concepts to the first problem, we can determine 
          the correct solution based on the central atom and relate it to the 
          number of bonds that the atom of the specific element typically
          has. A and B are incorrect because they have oxygen and sodium as central
          atoms, which isn't realistic as oxygen is understandably capable of having <strong>2</strong>
          bonds, and sodium has <strong>1</strong>. D is incorrect because it has
          a positive charge on the lowest oxygen atom, and from counting the electrons
          associated with the oxygens valence shell, there are 8, which is 2 more than oxygens ground-state
          of 6.
          <br>
          Correct Answer: C
          </br>

      <h3>Question 3</h3>
        <p>
          The best approach for this question is to follow the resonance for the electrons
          along and reveal this way which carbons are capable of adopting a negative charge.
          For resonance, electrons will never travel to a condition of less stabilility
          or thermodynamic nature. This is to say that carbon 1 cannot have the electrons in the π
          bond from onto it in order to form a lone pair as this creates a positive charge on carbon 2 
          and a negative charge on carbon 1, creating a significantly less stable compound. This being said,
          since the oxygen has a negative charge on it, a lone pair can jump down and create another double bond
          on carbon 1. However, since carbon 1 would have 5 bonds in this case, the double bond between it can jump
          to carbon 2 as a lone pair, giving it a negative charge. While this is a less stable condition than the 
          original state as oxygen is a more electronegative atom, it is still a possible resonance as 
          it redistributes the charge. Continuing this line of thinking, carbon 3 can't have a negative charge because it 
          would require the bond between it and carbon 4 to jump to either or to create two charges instead of 
          removing one to add one. However, if the lone pair now on carbon 2 jumps down to form a double bond between it and
          carbon 3, the aforementioned 3-4 double bond can become a lone pair on carbon 4
          giving it a negative charge. You can consider this same concept for carbon 6 and 7, as both are able to gain a 
          negative charge via distribution of lone pairs. Something of note is that the oxygen in position 8 can't gain a 
          negative charge as the double bond between it and its <strong>carbonyl</strong> carbon (a carbon speicifcally in a double bond with a oxygen)
          because there is nothing to recreate a double bond with the carbonyl carbon. The only other available electrons are the 5-6 double bond
          , but if these create this new double bond, then carbon 6 would gain a positive charge, only capable of being stabilized
          by the 6-7 double bond and 1-2 double bond, which will always end up with a carbon that has a positive charge the is unable to be stabilized
          (ends with a positive charge on 7 and 4 respectively).

      <h3>Question 4</h3>
        <p>
          For something to be a resonance structure, it needs to maintain the same atomic bonds and only involve
          the movement of electrons. If we look at A, there isn't just electron movement, as a hydrogen atom notably moves
          from the oxygen to the α-carbon to the carbonly carbon. B however is a resonance structure because it just involves the movement 
          of a lone pair on the oxygen to force the movement of electrons in a double bond to move to the nitrogen atom, retaining
          the same chemical bonds.

          Correct Answer: C

      <h3>Question 5</h3>
        <p>
          For the most part, geometric and electron geometry of a given molecule is mostly memory, with the general structure
